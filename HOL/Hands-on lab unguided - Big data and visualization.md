# Big data and visualization hands-on lab unguided 

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this workshop, you will deploy a web app using Machine Learning (ML) to predict travel delays given flight delay data and weather conditions. Plan a bulk data import operation, followed by preparation, such as cleaning and manipulating the data for testing, and training your Machine Learning model.

By attending this workshop, you will be better able to build a complete Azure Machine Learning (ML) model for predicting if an upcoming flight will experience delays. In addition, you will learn to:

-   Integrate the Azure ML web service in a Web App for both one at a time and batch predictions

-   Use Azure Data Factory (ADF) for data movement and operationalizing ML scoring

-   Summarize data with HDInsight and Spark SQL

-   Visualize batch predictions on a map using Power BI

This hands-on lab is designed to provide exposure to many of Microsoft's transformative line of business applications built using Microsoft big data and advanced analytics. The goal is to show an end-to-end solution, leveraging many of these technologies, but not necessarily doing work in every component possible. The lab architecture is below and includes:

-   Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML)

-   Azure Data Factory (ADF)

-   Azure Storage

-   HDInsight Spark

-   Power BI Desktop

-   Azure App Service

## Overview

AdventureWorks Travel (AWT) provides concierge services for business travelers. In an increasingly crowded market, they are always looking for ways to differentiate themselves, and provide added value to their corporate customers.

They are looking to pilot a web app that their internal customer service agents can use to provide additional information useful to the traveler during the flight booking process. They want to enable their agents to enter in the flight information and produce a prediction as to whether the departing flight will encounter a 15-minute or longer delay, considering the weather forecasted for the departure hour.

In this hands-on lab, attendees will build an end-to-end solution to predict flight delays, accounting for the weather forecast.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![The Solution Architecture diagram begins with Lab VM, then flows to Data Factory File Copy Pipeline, which flows to Storage for copied, raw file. This flows to Data Factory Batch Scoring pipeline, which includes Deployed ML Predictive Model (Batch). The pipeline flows to Storage for scored data, which flows to Spark for data processing. Power BI Report reads data from Spark, then sends the data on to Flight Booking Web App. Deployed ML Predictive Model (Request/Response) real-time scoring also sends data to the Flight Booking Web App, which then flows to the End User.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Bigdataandvisualizationimages/media/image2.png "Solution Architecture diagram")

The solution begins with loading their historical data into blob storage using Azure Data Factory (ADF). By setting up a pipeline containing a copy activity configured to copy time partitioned source data, they could pull all their historical information, as well as ingest any future data, into Azure blob storage through a scheduled, and continuously running pipeline. Because their historical data is stored on-premises, AWT would need to install and configure an Azure Data Factory Integration Runtime (formerly known as a Data Management Gateway). Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) would be used to develop a two-class classification machine learning model, which would then be operationalized as a Predictive Web Service using ML Studio. After operationalizing the ML model, a second ADF pipeline, using a Linked Service pointing to Azure ML's Batch Execution API and an AzureMLBatchExecution activity, would be used to apply the operational model to data as it is moved to the proper location in Azure storage. The scored data in Azure storage can be explored and prepared using Spark SQL on HDInsight, and the results visualized using a map visualization in Power BI.

## Exercise 5: Summarize data using HDInsight Spark

Duration: 20 minutes

In this exercise, you will prepare a summary of flight delay data in HDFS using Spark SQL.

### Task 1: Install pandas on the HDInsight cluster

#### Tasks to complete:

-   Create an SSH connection to the HDInsight cluster.

    -   Use password: Abc!1234567890

-   Install the latest version of pandas on the cluster

#### Exit criteria:

-   The version of pandas is updated to a version which supports the 'api' module.

### Task 2: Summarize delays by airport

#### Tasks to complete:

-   Navigate to your HDInsight Spark cluster in the Azure portal.

-   Open a new Jupyter Notebook, using a Spark kernel.

-   Generate Hive tables from your Scored Flight and Weather data, which can be queried using Spark SQL.

-   Load the data from the path \"/ScoredFlightsAndWeather/\*.csv\" and define a DataFrame with a schema and save it as a table called FlightDelays. The schema should look like the following:

    ![Screenshot of the FlightDelays schema.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Bigdataandvisualizationimages/media/image35.png "FlightDelays schema")

-   Save a Hive table named FlightDelaysSummary that represents the following query:
    ```
    %%sql
    SELECT  OriginAirportCode, OriginLatLong, Month, Day, Hour, Sum(DelayPredicted) NumDelays, Avg(DelayProbability) AvgDelayProbability 
    FROM FlightDelays 
    WHERE Month = 4
    GROUP BY OriginAirportCode, OriginLatLong, Month, Day, Hour
    Having Sum(DelayPredicted) > 1
    ```

#### Exit criteria:

-   You can run the following query and see similar results:\
    ![The Query Results are in a table that display information for four airports. Columns are: OriginAirportCode, OriginLatLong, Month, Day, Hour, NumDelays, and AvgDelayProbability.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Bigdataandvisualizationimages/media/image36.png "Query Results")

-   You have created flight delays summary Hive table, which can be queried from Power BI Desktop.

## Exercise 6: Visualizing in Power BI Desktop

### Task 1: Connect to the Lab VM

-   Create an RDP connection to your Lab VM.

#### Exit criteria:

-   You are logged into your Lab VM.

### Task 2: Connect to HDInsight Spark using Power BI Desktop

#### Tasks to complete:

-   Launch Power BI Desktop.

-   Connect to your HDInsight Spark instance, and query the Hive tables you created in the previous exercise.

#### Exit criteria:

-   You have successfully connected to your HDInsight Spark cluster, and have the fields from the flightdelaysummary Hive table loaded in the report design surface.

### Task 3: Create Power BI report

#### Tasks to complete:

-   Generate a Power BI report containing Map, Stacked Column Chart, and Treemap visualizations of the flight delay summary data.

-   The Map visualization should represent the number of delays, based on the location of the airport.

-   The Stacked Column Chart should provide information about the probability of a delay, based on the day.

-   The Treemap visual display details about the number of delays associated with a particular airport.

#### Exit criteria:

-   You should have a Power BI report generated, contain three interlinked tiles, displaying flight delay details.

    ![The Power BI report has a Map visualization, Stacked column chart, and treemap visualization.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Bigdataandvisualizationimages/media/image37.png "Power BI report")

## Exercise 7: Deploy intelligent web app

Duration: 20 minutes

In this exercise, you will deploy an intelligent web application to Azure from GitHub. This application leverages the operationalized machine learning model that was deployed in Exercise 1 to bring action-oriented insight to an already existing business process.
