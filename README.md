# Abstract

## Workshop

In this workshop, you will deploy a web app using Machine Learning (ML) to predict travel delays given flight delay data and weather conditions. Plan a bulk data import operation, followed by preparation, such as cleaning and manipulating the data for testing, and training your Machine Learning model.

By attending this workshop, you will be better able to build a complete Azure Machine Learning (ML) model for predicting if an upcoming flight will experience delays. In addition, you will learn to:

-   Integrate the Azure ML web service in a Web App for both one at a time and batch predictions

-   Use Azure Data Factory (ADF) for data movement and operationalizing ML scoring

-   Summarize data with HDInsight and Spark SQL

-   Visualize batch predictions on a map using Power BI

## Whiteboard Design Session
TBD

## Hand-on Lab
This hands-on lab is designed to provide exposure to many of Microsoft's transformative line of business applications built using Microsoft big data and advanced analytics. The goal is to show an end-to-end solution, leveraging many of these technologies, but not necessarily doing work in every component possible. The lab architecture is below and includes:

-   Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML)

-   Azure Data Factory (ADF)

-   Azure Storage

-   HDInsight Spark

-   Power BI Desktop

-   Azure App Service


## Azure services and related products
- Media Services
- Logic Apps
- Functions
- Video Indexer API
- App Services
